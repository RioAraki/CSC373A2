1. Use python
2. Learn how to construct a complete graph given the number of vertices (there would be limit on weight of edges like from 0 to 1 or vertice be on unit circle)
  2 - Without using any library?
3. Find MST and accumulate the cost of each edge to find the size of MST.
  3 - Algorithms learnt => Prim/ Kruskal

==================================

1. Don't counstruct a graph, counstruct a series of vertices, since the graph must be complete( must have edges among all points) -> apply kruskal algorithm to small graph and gradually add points
2. Use polar coordinate system?
3. data structure -> list of tuple in python
