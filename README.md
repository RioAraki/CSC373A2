Problem 1. Consider a complete graph on V vertices, where the length of each edge E is a real number drawn uniformly from [0...1]. Write a tool called randomMST that given the integer input V will construct such a graph and compute the size of the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST). Using the results, determine how the result varies as a function of V.


Problem 2. Consider a complete graph on V vertices, where each vertex is a point randomly positioned in the unit circle. Distance between two nodes is the eucledian distance between the points. Write a tool called circleMST that given the integer input V will construct such a graph and compute the size of the MST. Using the results, determine how the result varies
as a function of V.
